            "description": "Shared Use Paths (SUPs) are becoming very popular in North America due to the current initiatives that promote active travel. SUPs can accommodate different types of users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, scooterists, and skateboarders. Although the interest in SUPs continues to increase, relatively less research has been performed on their utilization, especially using revealed preferences. Therefore, this study utilizes the survey data collected from Edmonton, Canada, between June 12th to 19th 2018 to explore the likelihood of utilizing the SUPs and the associated frequency of use. Results indicate that not all variables associated with the likelihood of utilization are also associated with the frequency of use. Specifically, higher levels of education influence the likelihood of SUP utilization, while the higher frequency of SUP usage is influenced by the secondary modes of transportation. On the other hand, as the …"

            "description": "Crash counts are non-negative integer events often analyzed using crash frequency models such as the negative binomial (NB) distribution. However, due to their random and infrequent nature, crash data usually exhibit unique characteristics, such as excess zero observations that the NB distribution cannot adequately model. The negative binomial-Lindley (NBL) and random parameters negative binomial-Lindley (RPNBL) models have been proposed to address this limitation. Despite addressing the issues of excess zero observations, these models may not fully account for unobserved heterogeneity resulting from temporal variations in crash data. In addition, many variables, such as traffic volume, speed, and weather, change with time. Therefore, the analyst often requires disaggregated data to account for their variations. For example, it is recommended to use monthly crash datasets to better account for …"

This study explored the influential factors for SUP user diverse activities using multinomial regression on the survey data collected in Edmonton in 2018. The descriptive analysis revealed that walking was the activity with the highest frequency, followed by walking and cycling, and walking with pets, whereas cycling had the lowest priority. The multinomial model showed that as the age increases, residents are less likely to perform activities other than walking or cycling alone. Further, residents with higher education are more likely to …"

Likelihood ratio tests were employed to assess the overall stability of model estimates across the studied years, and a comparison was made between partially constrained and unconstrained temporal modelling approaches. The results reveal statistically significant differences in injury severity before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic."

The current Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) project developed speed-related crash modification factors (CMFs) for 12 different roadway facility types—rural highways, urban and suburban arterials, and rural and urban freeways—by using Washington and North Carolina data from three major databases: Second Strategic Highway Research Program Roadway Information Database, National Performance Management Research Dataset, and Highway Safety Information System (VTTI 2020; Iowa State University of Science and Technology 2023; National Academies of Sciences 2023; RITIS 2023; FHWA n.d.). The results show that speed variation (e.g., operating speed standard deviation) was the dominant speed measure for rural highways and rural and urban freeways, and speed differential (i.e., difference between the posted speed limit and average operating speed) was the dominant speed measure for urban and suburban arterials. In most cases, the association of speed variation/differential with crashes is positive. The researchers developed CMFs for 129 crash types and severity levels, and most obtained three-star CMF Clearinghouse ratings (AASHTO 2010; FHWA 2023a). These CMFs were developed through a data-driven safety analysis approach, and application of these CMFs (e.g., in HSM-related evaluation tools) requires …"

In this context, the behavior of one group can impact the experience of the other. Thus, this study applied an ordered logit model on survey data collected from Edmonton, Canada, to examine the six behaviors exhibited by SUP users. Results indicated that respondents were most concerned about cyclists not ringing the bell, followed by people not watching their dogs and cyclists' speed. Additionally, the model results revealed a clear pattern of concerns between walkers and cyclists. Cyclists were more likely to express concern about pedestrians spreading out and not staying to the right, while pedestrians exhibited similar concerns towards cyclists. Furthermore, older respondents expressed a greater concern regarding cyclists' speed, people passing on the right, cyclists not …"

The analysis is based on data collected from Louisiana State, encompassing 18,300 older driver-involved crashes (2017-2021). For analysis, a two-step hybrid modelling approach is employed: a) Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is used to classify top variable features and b) Correlated Random Parameter Ordered Probit with Heterogeneity in Means (CRPOP-HM) is used to predict the likelihood of crash injury severity. . Some of the critical factors increasing the likelihood of fatal-severe or injury crashes involving older drivers on high-speed segments include the manner of collision (rear-end, right-angle, single …"

This study examines the factors that influence work zone crashes, including traffic control devices, geometric configurations, traffic operations, and human factors. The study also investigates how these factors vary by work zone type, day of the week, and time of day. To explore these temporal and spatial impacts, the study utilized five years of fatal crash data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and applied association rules mining. The findings demonstrate that rear-end crashes and collisions with other vehicles are the primary contributing factors. Although some common patterns emerged in the association rules, the study …"

Bike Pittsburgh (BikePGH) conducted a 2019 survey to examine non-motorists' perceptions of AV safety. Using Bayesian network (BN) analysis, the study identified key factors such as safety perception, AV technology knowledge, and real-world interaction experiences that influence non-motorists' overall perception of AV safety using BikePGH survey data. The study also explored several counterfactual scenarios to gain insights into non-motorists' viewpoints on AV safety.

This investigation focused on driver behavior in Iran using a dual-pronged approach. Initially, self-reported driving behavior was analyzed using a Driving Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ), which was completed online by 453 drivers. The factor analysis of the questionnaire data emphasized the significant role of DBs in generating driving errors, lapses, unintentional violations, and intentional violations. The DBQ questions exhibited a clear factor structure, demonstrating high factor loadings and satisfactory internal stability. The findings indicated that advertising signages notably influenced drivers' behavior, particularly in instances of neglecting the behavior of the leading vehicle's driver (Lapse), disregarding pedestrian …"

            "description": "In the U.S., the interstate highway system is categorized as a controlled-access or limited-access route, and it is unlawful for pedestrians to enter or cross this type of highway. However, pedestrian-vehicle crashes on the interstate highway system pose a distinctive safety concern. Most of these crashes involve ‘unintended pedestrians’, drivers who come out of their disabled vehicles, or due to the involvement in previous crashes on the interstate. Because these are not ‘typical pedestrians’, a separate investigation is required to better understand the pedestrian crash problem on interstate highways and identify the high-risk scenarios. This study explored 531 KABC (K = Fatal, A = Severe, B = Moderate, C = Complaint) pedestrian injury crashes on Louisiana interstate highways during the 2014–2018 period. Pedestrian injury severity was categorized into two levels: FS (fatal/severe) and IN (moderate/complaint). The …"

The current study used resourceful, open-source data based on urban areas in Texas to identify the key patterns of speeding behavior and associated safety surrogates in the presence or absence of child occupants. A unique data analysis procedure known as Taxicab Correspondence Analysis (TCA) was used to analyze the data.

Because most existing HSM SPFs were developed for states other than Texas, SPF calibration is needed to apply for Texas highways. Calibration is conducted to account for differences in crash reporting procedures, thresholds, driver characteristics, animal population, and weather conditions, among others. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) sponsored Research Projects 0-7083 and 0-7067 that derived local calibration factors for the SPFs documented in the HSM Chapters 10, 11, 12, and 18. Researchers also developed new safety prediction models for frontage roads and ramp segments. These projects developed analysis spreadsheet tools to help implement the new models and facilitate analysis of all rural and urban roadway segments and intersections. The researchers developed training workshop and webinar materials to assist TxDOT practitioners and consulting firms in their application of these new resources. The researchers presented these workshops and the webinar to safety stakeholders about the safety prediction methods and usage of spreadsheet tools for estimating the average crash frequency at a particular site and in evaluating different cross-sectional alternatives. This training will help safety professionals in evaluating complex trade-offs between safety, operations, community impacts, and costs that are often necessary when planning …"

On a national level, recent research along with calls to change how speed limit are set, especially for city streets, have generated extensive discussion on future speed limit setting procedures. Within this TxDOT project, the Research Team conducted dialogs with TxDOT districts to learn about the practices and procedures being used, developed a number of products designed to increase the understanding of operating speed and of PSLs, and performed new research into operating speed relationships with roadway characteristics. The developed communication products include videos (one for engineers and one for the public), a pamphlet for public distribution, answers to common questions about speed and speed limits, and a workshop on state and national speed limit setting practices. Review of the literature along with this study’s evaluations confirmed that an increase in the PSL is typically associated with a smaller magnitude increase in operating speed and that higher operating speeds are associated with higher PSLs. Freeway geometric factors, including left and right shoulder widths and distance to downstream and upstream ramps by ramp type (entrance or exit), demonstrated to have a significant impact on operating speed. This study estimates that a strategy that entails modifying geometry, changing the PSL, and varying the level of law enforcement presence within the ranges included in this study may impact freeway operational speeds up to 6.2 mph (depending upon existing conditions along with the …"

In the first approach, through an on-road questionnaire survey, the self-reported behavior of 369 drivers when crossing an intersection enabled with SCTs was analyzed. In the second approach, the drivers’ behavior was studied through naturalistic driving studies at two signalized intersections equipped with SCTs in Babol, Iran. Analyzing vehicle–pedestrian conflicts indicated that the presence of SCTs had a significant influence on driving behavior. Also, the ending seconds of green lights, as critical times of the SCTs, led to changes in driving behavior. Increasing the vehicle …"

We have expanded and improved upon previous forecasts produced as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) and provide a reference forecast (the most likely future), and alternative scenarios assessing disease burden trajectories if selected sets of risk factors were eliminated from current levels by 2050.\nMETHODS\nUsing forecasts of major drivers of health such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI; a composite measure of lag-distributed income per capita, mean years of education, and total fertility under 25 years of age) and the full set of risk factor exposures captured by GBD, we provide cause-specific forecasts of mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by age and sex from 2022 to 2050 for 204 countries and territories, 21 GBD regions, seven super-regions, and the world. All analyses were done at the cause-specific level so that only risk factors deemed causal by the GBD comparative risk assessment influenced future trajectories of mortality for each disease. Cause-specific mortality was modelled using mixed-effects models with SDI and time as the main covariates, and the combined impact of causal risk factors as an offset in the model.

            "description": "Pedestrian-involved hit-and-run (PIHR) crashes represent a significant public health concern, and identifying patterns in these crashes can aid in developing effective countermeasures. Cluster correspondence analysis (CCA) is a multidimensional statistical technique that combines dimension reduction and clustering to identify patterns in categorical data. This method provides insights into underlying patterns and relationships among categories. The current study analyzed a Louisiana crash dataset of 2,201 PIHR crashes from 2015 to 2019 using CCA to identify underlying patterns. CCA identified six clusters, examined the top associative attributes, and assessed their cluster-to-dataset percentage ratio. The first two clusters, representing 66% of PIHR crashes, mainly involved crashes on city streets, occurring primarily during early night (7 to 11 p.m.) in Cluster 1 and the afternoon (12 noon to 4 p.m.) in Cluster 2 …"

Few studies have systemically examined the influence of socioeconomic and infrastructure-related disparities in macro-level traffic crash frequency. This study provides a framework to spatially examine the relationships between crash rates and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, as well as roadway infrastructure and traffic characteristics at the Census Block Groups (CBGs) level. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was first performed on the residual of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model to identify whether non-stationarity exists. Then, the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model and the Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) model were applied to assess the impacts of these factors on crash rates spatially and …"

SUPs can be built alongside or far from the roadway, with the former typically separated from vehicular traffic by a buffer. SUPs built off of roadways pose a lower risk of conflict with vehicular traffic. Given the crucial role of safety in SUP utilization, this study provides a targeted review of the existing literature and state of practice focusing on the implementation of the SUPs and design guidelines as well as factors, data, and approaches to estimate SUP user volume.

The research focuses on the integration of quantitative methods and granular naturalistic data to examine the impacts of different driving contexts on transportation system performance, safety, and reliability. The data is derived from real-life driving encounters between pedestrians and drivers in various settings, including urban areas (UAs), suburban areas (SUAs), marked crossing areas (MCAs), and unmarked crossing areas (UMCAs). By determining critical thresholds of spatial/temporal proximity-based safety surrogate techniques, vehicle–pedestrian conflicts are clustered through a K-means algorithm into different risk levels based on drivers' evasive actions in different areas. The results of the data analysis indicate that changing lanes is the key evasive action employed by drivers …"

Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a unique avenue for achieving these goals, presenting an opportunity to accurately estimate congestion measures by utilizing data from various sources, including agency-owned sensors, third-party providers, and extensive enterprise databases. The Texas Department of Transportation 0-7131 project aimed to bridge the current research gap through the implementation of two main project phases. The first phase verified the reliability of commercial data sources for transportation planning and operations. The second phase focused on identifying the most effective AI models or algorithms to meet the Agency’s needs based on specific use cases and data availability. Finally, the team developed a prototype decision support tool based on geographical information system technology. The findings provide valuable guidance for decision-makers to prioritize resources, allocate funding, and implement specific measures tailored to the unique characteristics and congestion patterns of different freeway segments."

These tools are acknowledged in the Project Development Process Manual and have been used by various district personnel, particularly in the evaluation of project alternatives or analysis of design exceptions. However, additional research is needed to address knowledge gaps as well as to develop updated local calibration factors for the models. Specifically, safety prediction models do not exist for 12-lane freeway segments or freeway segments with managed lanes (e.g., high-occupancy-vehicle or high-occupancy-toll lanes). The research team derived local calibration factors for models for urban freeway segments with 4–10 lanes, assessed the applicability of the 10-lane urban freeway model to freeway segments with 11 or more lanes, and developed new safety prediction models for segments with managed lanes. The research team also developed an analysis tool to help practitioners implement the new models to facilitate analysis of complex urban freeway configurations, such as cases where an urban freeway widening project requires challenging tradeoffs between narrowing lanes or inside or outside shoulders."

By leveraging data from a diverse range of historical and real-time sources, this study successfully developed a user interface for a navigation tool or application that offers informed and data-driven decisions regarding the safest navigation options. The interface considers multiple scoring factors, including safety, distance, travel time, and an overall scoring metric. This study made a distinctive and valuable contribution by designing and implementing a robust safe navigation tool driven by artificial intelligence. Unlike existing navigation tools that offer multiple uninformed route options, this tool provides users with an informed decision on the safest route. By leveraging advanced AI algorithms and integrating various data sources, this navigation tool enhances the accuracy and reliability of route selection, thereby improving overall road safety and ensuring users can make informed decisions for their journeys.

            "description": "Popular navigation applications such as Google Maps and Apple Maps provide distance-based or travel time based alternative routes with no real-time risk scoring. There is a need for a real-time navigation system that can provide the data-driven decision on the safest path or route. By leveraging data from a diverse range of historical and real-time sources, this study successfully developed a user interface for a navigation tool or application that offers informed and data-driven decisions regarding the safest navigation options. The interface considers multiple scoring factors, including safety, distance, travel time, and an overall scoring metric. This study made a distinctive and valuable contribution by designing and implementing a robust safe navigation tool driven by artificial intelligence. Unlike existing navigation tools that offer multiple uninformed route options, this tool provides users with an informed decision on the safest route. By leveraging advanced AI algorithms and integrating various data sources, this navigation tool enhances the accuracy and reliability of route selection, thereby improving overall road safety and ensuring users can make informed decisions for their journeys."

After declining for three decades, pedestrian fatalities in the United States have been increasing with 6,941 fatalities in 2020, the highest number for more than two decades, impeding progress toward a zero-deaths transportation system. The Pedestrian and Bicycle Crash Analysis Tool (PBCAT) was developed to describe the pre-crash actions of the parties involved to better define the sequence of events and precipitating actions that lead to crashes involving motor vehicles and pedestrians or cyclists. Undoubtedly, police crash data influence decision-making processes in the transportation agencies.

            "description": "Project Description: All interventions aimed at promoting walking and cycling as an alternative transportation must educate the public on the associated risk and account for it in order to allocate resources efficiently. There are two components to estimating injury risk–injury counts (the numerator) and a measure of exposure (the denominator). Injury count (fatalities and non-fatal injuries) or the numerator can be sourced from the state crash database (CRIS), however, that excludes events that do not involve a motor-vehicle. Additionally, crash data provides limited information on injury diagnosis beyond discrete identification of injury severity (eg, fatality, suspected serious injury, possible injury). The most popular and commonly used measure of exposure is population, for it is an easily available metric. However, population while a measure of the burden of injury, overestimates the risk among younger population and males (Keall, 1995). Furthermore, Buehler and Pucher (2021) argue that while per-capita rates are useful for controlling for changes in population across different countries when making country-level comparisons, they do not control for changes in walking, cycling, and driving rates over time within each country. The project estimated three different measures of exposure–annual trip count, annual distance travelled and annual trip duration–for pedestrians and bicyclists. Data Scope: The Areawide Non-Motorized Exposure Tool makes it easier for practitioners to obtain and summarize nationwide travel survey data to estimate pedestrian and bicyclist exposure to risk at statewide and metropolitan planning organization (MPO) area scales …"

            "description": "Gaining an understanding of speed–crash relationships is a critical issue in highway safety research. Because of the ongoing pandemic (COVID-19) there has been a reduction in traffic volume, and some early studies explain that speeding in an environment with less traffic is associated with a high number of crashes, especially fatal and serious injury crashes. This study aims to quantify the impact of operating speed on traffic crash occurrences. The study conflated several databases (speed data, roadway inventory data, and crash data) that contain data from Dallas, Texas, spanning from 2018 to 2020, to examine the speed–crash association. Using the negative binomial Lindley regression model, this study showed that the trends of crash prediction models vary over the years (2018, 2019, and 2020) by different injury severity levels (i.e., fatal crashes, fatal and incapacitating injury crashes). The 2020 models …"

Since distracted driving accounts for most pedestrian accidents, the present study seeks to demonstrate the danger posed to pedestrian crossing safety by talking with passengers. Based on a real-world driving approach, the current study examines how talking with a passenger affects a driver’s behavior when encountering pedestrians. A study of 41 participants’ driving behavior at different locations was conducted, and 2,922 conflicts with pedestrians were coded according to four conditions (without or with passengers, and at marked crossings or at other locations). Using binary regression, it was found that this factor near pedestrian crossing areas causes significant dysfunction in driving yielding behavior.

The results indicate that pedestrians with a relatively higher walking speed are more likely to be involved in critical near-crash events. Furthermore, critical pedestrian-involved near-crash events are highly associated with vehicles with driving speeds of less than 10 mph. A higher pedestrian volume is highly associated with critical near-crash events with left-turn vehicles. It is possible that a higher pedestrian volume increases the occurrence of jaywalking behavior or encourages more pedestrians to step into the crosswalk when they should not. By contrast, a higher pedestrian volume is highly associated with non-critical near-crash events with right-turn vehicles …"

This study examines the differences in driving behavior, road safety 32 attitudes, and driving habits between a developed country (the Netherlands) and a developing country 33 (Iran), which bear major differences in terms of crash involvement per population. Method: In this con-34 text, this study assesses the statistical association of crash involvement with errors, lapses, aggressive 35 driving incidents, and non-compliance with traffic rules, attitudes, and habits. Structural equation mod-36 eling was used to evaluate data obtained from 1,440 questionnaires (720 samples for each group). Results: 37 The results revealed that more insecure attitudes toward traffic-regulation observance, negative driving 38 habits, and risky behaviors, such as traffic rule violations act as influential factors of crash involvement. 39 Iranian participants showed a greater likelihood to get involved in violations and driving habits with a 40 higher level of risk. In addition, lower levels of safety attitudes toward traffic-regulation observance were 41 observed. On the other hand, Dutch drivers were more likely to report lapses and errors. Dutch drivers 42 also reported safer behavior in terms of unwillingness to engage in risky behaviors such as violations 43 (speeding and no-overtaking). The structural equation models for crash involvement based on behaviors, 44 attitudes, and driving habits were also evaluated for their accuracy and statistical fit using relevant indi-45 cators.

            "description": "Drowsy driving-related crashes have been a key concern in transportation safety. In Louisiana, 14% (1,758 out of 12,512) of police-reported drowsy driving-related crashes during 2015–2019 resulted in injury (fatal, severe, or moderate). Amid the calls for action against drowsy driving by national agencies, it is of paramount importance to explore the key reportable attributes of drowsy driving behaviors and their potential association with crash severity. Method: This study used 5-years (2015–2019) of crash data and utilized the correspondence regression analysis method to identify the key collective associations of attributes in drowsy driving-related crashes and interpretable patterns based on injury levels. Results: Several drowsy driving-related crash patterns were identified through crash clusters – afternoon fatigue crashes by middle-aged female drivers on urban multilane curves, crossover crashes by young …"

The current Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) project (OR 19-032), led by Texas A&M Transportation Institute (TTI), aimed to provide guidance on these crossing types. This study examined the crash data, surroundings of the crossing, and driver behavioral patterns using naturalistic driving and simulation data to identify suitable countermeasures and build communication between MDOT Traffic & Safety and Office of Rail to refine the guidelines. This project conducted four major tasks: 1) a comprehensive review on short-storage crossing related studies, 2) data preparation and development of safety indices for short-storage crossing locations, 3) development of driver behavior related safety scoring for different passive treatments using data from SHRP-2 naturalistic driving study (NDS) and simulation, and 4) development of a guidance document and final report on short-storage crossings in Michigan. The findings of literature review show that little research has been conducted to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of different treatments for grade crossings with short storage, outside of traffic signal preemption strategies. The results also revealed that the highest number of crashes occurred in southeast Michigan (Detroit area), and the lowest number occurred in the sparsely populated northern part of the state. The findings also show that short storage locations are mostly on local undivided roadways. Both NDS and simulation study results indicate that drivers face difficulties …"

Although traffic calming has proven an active approach to promoting traffic safety in recent years, limited studies have focused on its use in crash blackspots and its effectiveness at different distances. In the present study, the effect of perceptual calming on the speed behavior of drivers of light and heavy vehicles near the crash blackspots of a crash-prone road in Iran was studied before and after the installation of road signs. To that end, an experimental system through IoT technology that records and collects vehicles’ speeds was developed. The results of the study showed that the deceleration of vehicles is not the same for light and heavy vehicles. T-tests showed that changes in average speed start at distances of 50 meters before the sign location and continue to affect the behavior of light and heavy vehicle drivers up to distances of about 400 meters, although at a diminishing rate. The maximum deceleration was found to occur at initial distances of about 50 meters after the signs. The results of before-after evaluation indicate a longer effect on drivers of heavy vehicles than those of light vehicles. It can be concluded that the cautious behavior of drivers could continue up to a certain distance due to traffic calming, and thereafter, speed gradually increases. This finding re-iterates the high importance of traffic calming in crash-prone areas and also suggests that calming should be performed intermittently along consecutive crash-prone areas."

The report and accompanying resources will be of interest to those responsible for designing and maintaining the roadside environment. Long-term vegetation management strategies that decrease the need for routine chemical and mechanical vegetation control can reduce recurring maintenance costs, highway worker exposure to traffic, impacts to the environment and cultural resources, and maintenance-related delays to the traveling public. However, these strategies vary in their effectiveness, longevity, initial construction costs, maintenance requirements, and aesthetic values. A critical consideration is how any strategy may affect the safety performance of highway appurtenances, such as guardrails, cable barriers, and sign posts. This is because surface and soil conditions are part of the design of roadside safety appurtenances, so designers need to understand any potential interactions between design elements that can affect safety performance."

To understand the future of scientific writing in the era of ChatGPT, it is important to explore ChatGPT and human-generated texts for manuscript preparation. This study aimed to evaluate the capability of ChatGPT to prepare a manuscript for publication by comparing its output with actual published content using supervised and unsupervised text mining approaches. This study used the introduction sections of 327 published articles on traffic safety. To obtain the ChatGPT-generated introduction section, a prompt with instructions and the title of 327 manuscripts was supplied to ChatGPT. Five supervised text classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Logitboost, and Neural Network (NNet), were applied to classify human-generated versus ChatGPT-generated introductions. Two unsupervised approaches, Text Network Analysis (TNA) and Text Cluster, were used to identify the difference in textual contents in human-generated and ChatGPT-generated introductions. Results indicate a significant disparity between human-generated and ChatGPT-generated introductions. The accuracy of the supervised text classifiers ranged between 96.4% and 99.5%; SVM, RF, and NNet performed have higher precision.

            "description": "With the expanding popularity of Web 2.0, there has been a huge surge in the use of social media, like Twitter, to express user sentiments or opinions. Delays and breakdowns in transit operations can make riders annoyed and irritated, and as a result, they express their anger and frustration via social media posts. Understanding the tipping points of public frustration will help in developing better solutions. This study aims to develop a framework by developing multilevel sentiment analysis and determine the emotion and politeness measures using transit-related tweets from New York (New York City) and California (San Francisco). The popular hashtags associated with the transit systems of New York and California were collected during 2019. The words associated with negative sentiments widely differ in these two states. Moderate levels of differences are seen in the politeness measures for these two states …"

Since the number of these crashes is increasing, it is important to investigate light vehicle crashes to gain insights into potential contributing factors. This study collected seven years (2010-2016) of data from traffic crash narrative reports and structured traffic crash data from Louisiana. Using text search options and manual exploration, a database of 1,623 light delivery-related crashes was examined with a comparatively robust clustering method known as cluster correspondence analysis. The findings identified six clusters with specific traits. The key clusters are fatigue, alcohol impairment, young drivers on low to moderate speed roadways, open country and moderate speed state/U.S. highways, and interstate-related crashes due to inattention. Policymakers can use the findings …"

The non-linear models were computed for periods typical of BL Her stars, i.e. 1 ≤ P(days) ≤ 4, covering a wide range of input parameters: metallicity (−2.0 dex ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ 0.0 dex), stellar mass (0.5–0.8 ), luminosity (50–300 ) and effective temperature (full extent of the instability strip; in steps of 50K). We investigate the impact of four sets of convection parameters on multi-wavelength properties. Most empirical relations match well with theoretical relations from the BL Her models computed using the four sets of convection parameters. No significant metallicity effects are seen in the PR relations. Another important result from our grid of BL Her models is that it supports combining PL relations of RR …"

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recently permitted the deployment of automated delivery vehicles (ADVs) with low-speed thresholds. Unlike conventional low-speed vehicles, these ADVs are designed to have no human occupants and they operate exclusively using an automated driving for delivery purpose. ADVs can reduce costs of delivery, release less harmful emissions, improve time efficiency, and increase traffic safety and congestion. This is due to their automated system, dynamic route planning, and sensors that allow a better understanding of the environment. With the increasing demand for delivery services and cost-effective delivery options, there has been increases in research, company manufacturing, and usage of ADVs. Although there are many safety concerns due to the frequent stops on driveway prone residential localities, safety-related issues of these vehicles have not been explored. Additional concerns pertaining to ADVs include network performance demands, privacy issues, and trust of the public. This study performed a comprehensive scoping review on the safety and operational aspects of ADVs by looking at important topics related to ADVs and identifying the key aspects of prominent studies."

Due to their intrinsic architecture, conventional neural networks cannot be successfully trained and scoped when data is sparse, which is the case in many scientific and engineering domains. Nonetheless, neural networks provide a solid foundation to respect physics-driven or knowledge-based constraints during training. Generally speaking, there are three distinct neural network frameworks to enforce the underlying physics: (i) physics-guided neural networks (PgNNs), (ii) physics-informed neural networks (PiNNs), and (iii) physics-encoded neural networks (PeNNs). These methods provide distinct advantages for accelerating the numerical modeling of complex multiscale multi-physics phenomena. In addition, the recent developments in neural operators (NOs) add another dimension to these new simulation paradigms, especially when the real-time prediction of complex multi-physics systems is required. All these models also come with their own unique drawbacks and limitations that call for further fundamental research. This study aims to present a review of the four neural network frameworks (i.e., PgNNs, PiNNs, PeNNs, and NOs) used in scientific computing research. The state-of-the-art architectures and their applications are reviewed, limitations are discussed, and future research opportunities in terms of improving algorithms, considering …"

This study applied the cluster correspondence analysis (CCA) method, a unique method in combination with cluster analysis and correspondence analysis, to generate clusters by partitioning of individual attributes based on the profiles over the categorical variables identified through dimensional reduction of the dataset. In addition to the biplots illustrating the association of …"

It is extensively used to systematically evaluate the crash risk associated with roadway elements. To estimate the expected crashes, the Empirical Bayesian (EB) approach is typically employed. The EB method is a computationally convenient approximation to the Full Bayesian (FB) method, which gained popularity due to its simple interpretation, computational efficiency, and the ability to account for the regression to the mean bias. However, the common EB method used in traffic safety analysis is only applicable when the traditional Negative Binomial (NB) model is used. The NB model, however, is not a suitable choice when data is highly dispersed, skewed, or has a large number of zero observations.

David Minsk (1970), one of the first recorded conferences on snow removal was held in Philadelphia in 1914. The discussions centered around improving snow removal with horses and carts. The passage of the 1916 Federal-Aid Road Act created a need to advance snow removal because roads were beginning to be networked together. Up until the early 1940s, research efforts across the country were focused on improving plows attached to motorized vehicles to advance mechanical snowplowing (Minsk, 1970). Before World War II, few US cities used salt for winter operations. Local governments plowed roads and then spread sand and cinders to improve traction. Automobiles donned snow chains, and the public generally accepted that roads would not always be passable in icy conditions (Plumer, 2015). The February 2014 issue of National Geographic reported that “because of its local resource, Detroit was the first city in the world to apply salt to its roads in 1940”(Howard, 2014). In February 1941, sodium chloride was first used as an ice preventive by the State of New Hampshire (Minsk, 1970). Following the Second World War and the expansion of the national highway system, the use of road salt dramatically increased. At that time, cities and their suburbs adopted “bare-pavement” policies under which motorists could expect snow-and ice-free pavements shortly after storms, which resulted in a doubling of salt use every 5 years in the 1950s and 1960s, from 1 million tons in 1955 to nearly 10 million tons less than …"

Many agencies use stratified sampling procedures to develop default AADT estimates for uncounted segments; however, there is limited guidance and information about how to stratify the network effectively. The goal of this paper is to enhance transportation agencies’ ability to improve existing stratification schemes, design new schemes, and ultimately develop more accurate AADT estimates for NFAS roads.

            "description": "In the United States, flooding related crashes have exposed the vulnerability of transport networks. Without realizing the depth of a flooded roadway, some may attempt to cross. At night during heavy storms, determining if a road is flooded is especially difficult. Only 18–24 inches of moving water are needed to sweep away a truck, and only 6 inches are needed to carry away a small car. Louisiana’s geographic location places the state in a unique position to receive both frontal tropical hurricanes and large air masses, which may result in high air moistures in almost any direction and drop rain with heavy intensity. In 2016, 12% of flooding related crashes occurred in Louisiana. During 2010–2016, flooding resulted in a total of 449 crashes in Louisiana with a total of 22 fatalities. This study collected seven years (2010–2016) of flooding related crash data to identify the key contributing factors. The findings show that two …"

            "description": "Speeding-related crashes are one of the dominant types of crashes on rural roadways. As a result, the Texas Strategic Highway Safety Plan has identified speeding as one of the seven research emphasis areas for 2017–2022. Additionally, inclement weather plays a role in crash occurrences. This study used crash data with the inclusion of roadway geometry, traffic volume, 5-minute interval operating speed data, and 5-minute interval weather data to develop safety performance functions for the major rural roadway facility types: rural twolane roadways, rural multilane divided roadways, rural multilane undivided roadways, and rural freeways. The models were developed based on annual and daily levels. The results of the annual-level analysis show that increased variability in operational speed is associated with increased crashes for all four roadway facilities. Average precipitation shows a positive association for only rural multilane undivided and rural two-lane roadways. The results in the daily-level analysis show that increased variability in daily operational speed (the standard deviation of the daily average of 5-minute interval operation speeds) is associated with increased day-level crashes for all four roadway facilities. As daily average precipitation increases, the likelihood of a day-level crash occurrence increases for all facility types. This project also developed an interactive web-based decision support tool that assists practitioners in understanding saf ety scoring of roadway segments of interest with respect to not only roadway or traffic characteristics but also operating speed and weather conditions."

            "description": "This project investigated the influence of intersection corner radius on pedestrian crashes and right-turn vehicle speed. The corner radius can be unique to each corner at an intersection; therefore, this study assigned crashes to an intersection corner rather than to the entire intersection. For corner-level pedestrian crashes, the following variables were found to be positively related: pedestrian volume on the approach leg, pedestrian volume on the receiving leg, vehicle volume on the approach leg, vehicle volume on the receiving leg, corner radius, and shoulder width. The number of pedestrian crashes was higher when both legs at a corner were one-way streets with traffic moving away from the corner or when there was a mix of two-way and one-way operations present at the intersection. Fewer pedestrian crashes occurred when on-street parking existed on the approach leg. The findings from the study support the development of a crash modification factor (CMF) for corner radius. Assuming a baseline condition of 10 ft, the pedestrian CMFs for corner radius for the range of corner radii included in the evaluation went from 1.00 for a 10-ft radius to 1.59 for a 70-ft radius. In the operational analysis, right-turn speeds were found to be a function of corner radius. Other variables that influenced right-turn speed included headway to the preceding vehicle, traffic signal indication (yellow versus green), turning vehicle type (car or truck), and preceding vehicle movement (straight or right). The final selected model from this study can be used to predict turning speeds at different percentile levels. For example, the model can predict 50th or 85th percentile …"

This analysis addresses this need. A review of the research literature identified cultural groups and how those different groups approach age of first consumption, consistent alcohol usage, and binge drinking. The analysis of previous research identified key risk factors associated with alcohol-involved crashes. This analysis was performed at two spatial levels: parish and census block group. Descriptive statistics were computed at the parish level, followed by a comprehensive systemic analysis at the block group level. High-risk locations were identified at a granular level, including the top 50 block groups. A survey of the general population demonstrated that a large proportion of respondents perceived drinking and driving as an unacceptable behavior while also indicating that they themselves drink and drive, including drinking while driving. Respondents supported countermeasures such as sobriety checkpoints, especially during festivals, fairs, and parades; increased access to free, safe rides; and treatment for alcoholism and alcohol abuse. Gaps in the data for Louisiana were identified. These included the perspective of offenders charged with driving under the influence (DUI) or driving while intoxicated (DWI). These gaps were addressed through an online survey of DUI/DWI offenders and structured interviews with key stakeholders. The offender survey assessed beliefs and opinions of those charged with DUI/DWI in terms of the underlying reasons people drink and drive, and potential methods for …"

            "description": "In Texas, four-lane undivided roadways constitute a significant amount of mileage in rural areas. These highways have poor safety performance compared to other cross sections. However, there is not always sufficient space within the available right of way to accommodate a traditional four-lane divided cross section. Thus, a framework can assist road design engineers in making decisions on cross sections for new and resurfaced rural roadway segments to optimize operational and safety performance. In this research project, researchers evaluated the safety and operational benefits of converting four-lane undivided highways into other cross-section alternatives without changing the total roadway width. First, researchers selected a sample of rural highway segments with various cross sections, including four-lane undivided, four lane with 4-ft median buffer, four lane with two-way left-turn lane (TWLTL), Super 2, and Super 2 with TWLTL. They analyzed crash data on each cross section to determine the relationship between crash frequency, exposure, access-point density, horizontal curvature, cross-sectional widths, and operating speed variables. Second, researchers collected operating speed data in the field and developed VISSIM simulation models to evaluate the operational impacts of different cross sections considered in the project. Based on safety and operational effects, researchers developed a framework that allows the analyst to select a cross section depending on traffic volume, heavy vehicle mix, cross-sectional width, and access-point density."

To provide more insights into near-crash behavior, this study classified near-crash events into two severity levels: trivial near-crash events (-7.5 g ≤ deceleration rate ≤ -4.5 g) and non-trivial near-crash events (≤-7.5 g). From the perspective of descriptive statistics, the frequency of the itemsets, a set of categories of various variables, generated by the Apriori algorithm suggests that near-crash events are highly associated with several factors, including roadways without access control, driving during non-peak hours, roadways without a shoulder or a median, roadways with the minor arterial functional class, and roadways with a speed limit between 30 …"

However, the World Health Organization estimated that the true number of traffic fatalities in Bangladesh ranges between 20,730 and 29,177. Editorial traffic crash reports in Bangladesh, and the number of crashes that are reported, vary widely among different media outlets. This study employed a Google News Alert to collect fatal crash reports from online English daily newspapers. The current study compiled a database of 419 fatal crash-related reports over a six-month period (November 2018–April 2019). The reports contain a total of 81,019 words. The results of this study reveal that online news coverage of traffic fatalities tends to vary from news agency to news agency. Furthermore, these reports do not usually …"

There are no specific SPFs for low-volume roadways in the HSM. It is important to know that low-volume roadways are the major roadway types in terms of total mileage. This study used 2015–2019 crash data from Texas, incorporating with other relevant geometric and traffic variables, to develop SPFs for a specific low-volume roadway type (rural minor collector two-lane roadways). This study proposed a rules-based SPF developed approach that makes the prediction accuracies higher compared to the full model.

In 2016, 27% of the 37,461 traffic fatalities on U.S. roadways occurred at or near intersections. Nearly 70% of intersection-related fatalities occurred at unsignalized intersections. At such intersections, vehicles stopping or slowing to turn create speed differentials between vehicles traveling in the same direction. This is particularly problematic on two-lane highways. Research was performed to analyze safety performance for intersections on rural, two-lane roadways, with stop control on the minor roadway. Roadway, traffic, and crash data were collected from 4148 stop-controlled intersections of all 64 Parishes (counties) statewide in Louisiana, for the period of 2013 to 2017.

Gross and Jovanis (5) conducted a survey of universities and related institutes in the United States to assess the existing college-level courses in transportation safety and associated topics. This study focused on safety-related content in the transportation courses of civil engineering departments and injury prevention courses of public health programs. The findings of the Gross and Jovanis study showed that there is an evolving need for core competencies to be addressed in highway safety courses that are offered at the university level.\nThe core competencies do not represent all of the knowledge and skills necessary for a safety professional to be successful. Instead, they represent the core components that one must know in the overall field of transportation safety. Other relevant knowledge and skills needed include an understanding of statistics and evaluation processes, public affairs, engineering judgment, effective communications, and social marketing. Upon examination of a typical course syllabus, core competencies are similar to the identified key learning modules as presented by other disciplines in similar fields.

This study utilizes a near-crash dataset extracted from a naturalistic driving study to explore the patterns of near-crash events with or without the involvement of secondary tasks as a surrogate approach to understand the impact of these behaviors on traffic safety. The dataset contains information about driver behaviors, such as secondary tasks, vehicle maneuvers, other conflict vehicles’ maneuvers before and during near-crash events, and the driving environment. The patterns for near-crashes with or without the involvement of secondary tasks are mined by adopting the apriori association rule algorithm. Finally, the mined rules for the near-crash events with or without the involvement of the secondary tasks are analyzed and compared. The results demonstrate that near …"

Vehicle defects have an adverse effect upon overall roadway safety as they can increase the likelihood of traffic crashes, thus increasing the frequency of crash-related injuries and fatalities. Even though Louisiana requires a biennial vehicular safety inspection, recent traffic crash statistics have shown a higher than average percentage of vehicle defect–related crash fatalities in Louisiana (3% of all traffic fatalities). This fact called for an in-depth analysis of the vehicle defect–related crashes in Louisiana. The current study used 7 years (2010–2016) of traffic crash data from Louisiana to investigate the association between crash severity and vehicle-defect types by applying a Bayesian data mining approach.

Mixed logit models with three approaches were employed, namely random parameters, random parameters with heterogeneity in means, and random parameters with heterogeneity in means and variances. The investigation covered four years (2015–2018) of motor vehicle crashes in South Australia, and the injury severity was categorized into no injury, minor injury, and severe injury. Log-likelihood ratio tests revealed that there is a significant temporal instability in the four years of crashes.

Many research efforts have focused on high-volume roadways that typically experience more crashes. A few studies have documented SPFs for non-federal aid system (NFAS) roads including rural minor collectors, rural local roads, and urban local roads. NFAS roads are characterized by unique features such as lower speeds, and shorter segment lengths, and they usually experience fewer crashes given the low exposure of these roads. As a result, there is a clear need to investigate the associated safety issues of NFAS roadways and generate distinct SPFs for them. The main objective of this study is to bridge the gap in the literature and develop SPFs for NFAS roads.

If these relationships are well understood and characterized, existing techniques and countermeasures for reducing crash frequencies and crash severities could potentially improve, and the opportunity for new methodologies addressing and anticipating crash occurrence would naturally ensue. This study examines the prevailing operating speeds on a large scale and determines how traffic speeds and different speed measures interact with roadway characteristics and weather condition to influence the likelihood of crashes.

This study utilized an unsupervised learning method, known as factor analysis, on a unique distracted driving dataset to understand PUWD behavior from the roadway geometry and operational perspectives. The results indicate that the presence of a shoulder, median, and access control on the relatively higher functional class roadways could encourage more PUWD events. The roadways with relatively lower speed limits could have high PUWD event occurrences if the variation in operating speed is high. The results also confirm the correlations between the frequency of PUWD events and the frequency of distracted crashes. This relationship is strong on urban roadways. For rural roadways, this correlation is only strong on the roadways with a large amount of PUWD events. The findings could help transportation …"

            "description": "According to 2011–16 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), approximately 2.6% of fatal crashes in the United States involved vehicle-related faults as a primary contributing factor. Previous studies indicate that a majority of technological defects are identified during inspection of wearable parts such as lights, tires, and brakes. However, the proportion of vehicle failures that can be contributed to crash occurrences was revealed to not have changed fundamentally since the 1970s. In the United States, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) suggests that each state implement a program to inspect all registered vehicles (annually or biennially) to guarantee that unsafe vehicles are taken off the roads. Nonetheless, it is critical to acknowledge that studies lack any correlation between crash rates and inspection programs related to vehicle component failure. When legislation restricted the NHTSA’s authority to reserve highway funding in 1976, the number of states with vehicle inspection programs has decreased. As of July 2015, only 16 states continue to implement the recommended regular safety inspection program. Safety inspection regulations in Canada vary from province to province. The Ministry of Justice in Canada provides a detailed regulation in the document “Motor Vehicle Safety Act”(The Ministry of Justice, Canada, 2019). According to the directive 2014/45/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on “periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers and repealing Directive 2009/40/EC”(issued on April 3, 2014),“all member states need to carry out periodic safety inspections for most …"

The expectation is to use AADT estimates in data-driven safety analysis. Because collecting data on NFAS roads is financially difficult, agencies are interested in exploring affordable ways to estimate AADT. The goal of this project was to determine the accuracy of AADT estimates developed from alternative data sources and quantify the impact of AADT on safety analysis. The researchers compared 2017 AADT data provided by the Texas and Virginia Departments of Transportation against probebased AADT estimates supplied by StreetLight Data Inc. Further, the research team developed safety performance functions (SPFs) for Texas and Virginia and performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects of AADT on the results obtained from the empirical Bayes method that uses SPFs. The results showed that the errors stemming from the probe AADT estimates were lower than those reported in a similar study that used 2015 AADT estimates. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the impact of AADT on safety analysis mainly depends on the size of the network, the AADT coefficients, and the overdispersion parameter of the SPFs."

It is anticipated that seven generations are still playing role as driver, non-motorist, or occupant: the Greatest generation, the Silent generation, Baby boomers, Millennials, Generation Z, and Post Z. This study used nine years (2010-2018) of Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data to provide some insights about traffic fatalities and different generations. This study provides some intuitive exploratory analysis with data visualization tools. As Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials are the top three generations in terms total number of fatalities, odds ratios have been developed to determine the specific traits that are associated with each generation. The findings of this unique analysis will provide more contexts to the generation-based studies."

Because of the increasing number of these crashes, it is important to investigate light vehicle crashes to gain insights about potential contributing factors. This study collected seven years (2010-2016) of data from traffic crash narrative reports and structured traffic crash data from Louisiana. By using text search options and manual exploration, a database of 1623 light delivery related crashes have been examined by using a comparatively robust clustering method known as cluster correspondence analysis. The findings identified six clusters with specific traits. The key clusters are interstate related crashes due to inattention, fatigue, alcohol impairment, or a young driver on low to mode speed roadways. The findings of the current study can be used by the policy makers to perform data-driven policy development in a way to ensure safety for delivery related travels."

RGCs generate a range of transport, economic, social, and environmental impacts. Safety at RGCs is one of the high-priority concerns among transportation agencies. However, little research has been performed on the patterns of key contributing factors associated with RGC crashes. The aim of this study is to identify the patterns of key contributing factors that are associated with RGC related fatal crashes. This study collected nine years (2010-2018) of fatal RGC crashes from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) to perform the analysis. To do so, this study Taxicab Correspondence Analysis (TCA), the current analysis identifies several key clusters that trigger RGC related fatal crashes. The key clusters are extremely fatal (more than one fatality) impaired crashes during inclement weather, fatal crashes local low-speed roadways at dark with no lighting, aligned county roadways, single fatal non-impaired crashes, crashes on multilane divided roadways due to turning/stopping, and crashes on high speed state highways when negotiating a curve. The findings from the current study can be used by authorities to improve RGC safety."

            "description": "Wrong-way driving (WWD) has been a long-lasting issue for transportation agencies and law enforcement, since it causes pivotal threats to road users. Notwithstanding being rare, crashes occurring due to WWD are more severe than other types of crashes. It is time consuming to identify true WWD crashes from large crash database. It often involves a large man-hours to review hardcopy of crash reports. Otherwise, it may cause overestimation or underestimation of WWD crash frequencies. To fill this gap, the present study aims at identifying WWD crashes from other motor vehicle crashes in police reports. By applying text mining techniques, useful information can be extracted from the crash report narratives. In order to distinguish real WWD crashes from other motor vehicle crashes, machine learning methods were implemented to develop classification algorithms. In this study, four classification algorithms, including Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN) were implemented to categorize crash reports as WWD and non-WWD crashes. Hardcopies of crash reports were used to evaluate the performance of each classification algorithm. Results indicated that RF outperformed in identifying true WWD crashes in comparison with other algorithms with the highest accuracy of 98%."

The number of studies has been exponentially growing for this topic. It can be noted that transportation is one of the sectors that has been drastically affected by the consequences of COVID-19. As this branch of research is growing fast, it is important to get an overall understanding of the ‘pandemic and transportation’related studies. This study collected relevant studies on this topic from the past 15 years. This study performed three major tasks: 1) conducted a brief literature review on the related studies, 2) performed bibliometric and scientometric analysis on the collected studies, and 3) developed topic models from the unstructured textual data in paper or report titles and abstracts. The findings show that the research trends in ‘COVID-19’and ‘pre COVID-19’studies have some common issues. However,‘pre COVID-19’papers are mostly associated with guidelines and strategic planning. As COVID-19 is still an ongoing pandemic, the research topics are mostly associated with impact and consequences. As one of the earlier studies on this topic, this study sheds some insights into the ongoing discussions about ‘pandemic and transportation.’"

The usage of CSSs has significantly improved in the U.S. over the last 40 years, but it is anticipated that the usage of CSSs in popular ridesharing services (RSSs), such as Uber and Lyft, is not widespread. This paper used a publicly available nationwide internet survey that was designed to gain an understanding of riders and drivers perception toward child passenger safety in regard to technological perception on RSSs. This study performed a rigorous exploratory data analysis to identify the key psychological insights of the survey participants. Additionally, a recently developed dimension-reduction method has been applied to understand the co-occurrence patterns of the responses to gain intuitive insights. It is found that urban-dwelling parents with higher education degrees eventually use RSSs often due to their familiarity of the technological advantages. On the other hand, non-urban and moderately educated parents and guardians are dismissive in using RSSs while having kids with them to ride due to less trust on the technology."

The ecosystem services provided by minimizing roadside vegetation maintenance practices can include ecosystem diversity, stormwater quantity and quality management, carbon sequestration, conservation and/or restoration of pollinator and/or wildlife habitat, and aesthetics. A key safety benefit comes from reducing maintenance personnel exposure to traffic hazards, equipment, and chemical treatments. This provides both short-term and long-term cost savings and benefits.

            "description": "Extremely serious traffic crashes, defined as having a death toll of two and greater than two, have become a serious safety concern on urban roadways in Louisiana. This study examined the different contributing factors of these crashes to determine significant trends and patterns. We collected traffic crash data from Louisiana during the period of 2013 to 2017 and found that a total of 72 extremely serious crashes (around 2% of all traffic fatalities) occurred on Louisiana urban roadway networks. As crash data contain an enormous list of contributing factors, there was an issue of ‘more features than data points’ in solving the research problem. Most of these variables are categorial in nature. We selected a dimension reduction tool called Taxicab Correspondence Analysis (TCA) to investigate the complex interaction between multiple factors under a two-dimensional map. Findings of the study reveal several key …"

Understanding the associations between trip/driving/roadways features and speeding behavior is crucial for both researchers and practitioners. This research utilized naturalistic driving data collected by the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) program and roadway features from a road inventory dataset - Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS), provided by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), to investigate the hidden rules that associated trip/driving/roadway features with speeding behavior. A classification-based association (CBA) algorithm was adopted to explore the hidden rules from two perspectives of speeding: speeding duration and speeding pattern.

Abdel-Aty and Radwan studied speed by capturing the magnitude of speeding relative to the posted speed limit. 1 This speeding indicator variable was shown to affect the crash involvement of male and young drivers. The preliminary analysis of a study conducted by Taylor et al. based in the United Kingdom revealed that the average speed was negatively related to crash frequency. 2 Pei et al. showed that crash risk is negatively associated with mean speed when controlling for distance exposure, which goes with the argument that roadway segments designed for higher speeds should deliver better road safety performance. 3 However, for time exposure, this association was positive. Imprialou et al. showed that speed-crash relation is positive for condition-based approach. 4 However, the outcome of the link-based model is the opposite. Several other studies examined the similar research questions. 5-10 However, the overall findings are not similar in nature. Few recent studies investigated the association between weather and crash outcomes. 11, 12 The literature review reveals that additional research is needed to investigate the association between crash, operating speed, weather, roadway, and traffic measures."

With the explosive number of GPS devices, there are massive vehicle GPS trajectory data sets whose sizes are beyond the traditional trajectory analysis method's capability. This study utilizes Apache Spark™ to build up a framework whose output data can be compatible with machine learning algorithms for vehicle category classification. Five types of features were extracted from the GPS trajectory data, namely driving habits statistics, trajectory sample quality statistics, geographical information statistics, origin and destination cluster statistics, and temporal statistics. The spatial clustering algorithm and spatial join are incorporated in the workflow, significantly broadening the number of features for the training data set. The results show that the five types of statistics extracted from the trajectory are adequate for distinguishing different vehicle categories by machine learning algorithms. The same accuracy rank sequence for the vehicle classes was observed across different types of features and algorithms, and the decision tree ensemble algorithms have better performance over the logistic regression and support vector machine algorithms."

This notable freight-haul growth has allowed continuous day–night movement of freight on roads and highways, exposing the trucks to a greater number of potential crashes or near-crash scenarios. There are many ongoing research efforts that aim to identify the different factors that influence large truck crashes; however, further research with innovative approaches is still needed to better understand the relationship between crash-related factors.

Lack of scientific guidelines and comprehensive organic package of practice (POP) has rendered the objective unachievable. The present study was initiated at Howrah Krishi Vigyan Kendra in 2015 and 2016 to evaluate the potential of Inhana Rational Farming (IRF) Technology, an organic POP, towards increasing crop productivity and restoration of soil quality under rice cultivation under different farming model viz. organic, integrated, non-pesticidal crop management as well as KVK.s recommendation with reduced fertilizer dosage. Treatments with organic plant management practices (IRF technology) showed 5% higher crop productivity (4774 kg/ha) in comparison to conventional farmers’ practice (4537 kg/ha) for Swarna sub-1 rice variety. Where as in case of scented rice varieties like Gobindobhog, the organic practice showed highest crop performance (3194 kg/ha) among all the treatments, and achieved 17% higher yield than that obtained under conventional farmers’ practice (2726 kg/ha). Also the non-pesticidal crop management, a new concept of synthetic pesticide free crop cultivation under IRF Technology showed higher crop performance (4991 kg/ha and 2978 kg/ha in Swarna sub-1 and Gobindobhog rice varieties respectively) than conventional farmers practice.

The first effort evaluated passively gathered crowdsourced bicyclist activity data from StreetLight Data and found promising correlations (R2 of 62% and 69% for monthly weekday and weekend daily averages) when the StreetLight data were compared to bicyclist counts from 32 locations in eight Texas cities, and even better correlation (R2 of 94%) when compared with countywide Strava data expanded to represent total bicycling activity. The second effort evaluated the pedestrian counting accuracy of the Miovision system and found 15% error for daytime and 24% error for nighttime conditions. The third effort used INRIX trip trace data to determine origin-destination patterns and developed 40 decision rules to define the origin-destination patterns. The fourth effort analyzed crowdsourced Waze data (i.e., traffic incidents) and found it to be a reliable alternative to observed and predicted crashes, with the ability to identify high-risk locations: 77% of high-risk locations identified from police-reported crashes were also identified as high-risk in Waze data. The researchers propose a method to treat the redundant Waze reports and to match the unique Waze incidents with police crash reports."

Thus, this project’s goal was to quantitatively investigate safety of intersections on curves, specifically the Two-Way Stop-Controlled (TWSC) intersections. The analysis results show that clearly there is a safety problem associated with intersections placed on horizontal curves and the magnitude of the problem depends on the AADT, curve radius, intersection skewness angle, number of intersection legs, and speed limit on major road. The single vehicle crashes are the most common type of crashes on curve intersections, particularly on rural two-lane highways. With the …"

We used Florida rural roadway crash data from the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) to investigate improper passing/lane-change related crashes. We applied an unsupervised data mining technique (known as association rules negative binomial (NB) miner) to extract the knowledge pattern of co-occurrence of the significant variables.

The amount of crowd sourced data from private mobility companies is rapidly expanding to include data sources that were previously not available; this data can assist in developing new approaches and algorithms to understand travel patterns and origin-destination (OD) distributions. We acquired four months (February, June, July, and October of 2015) of INRIX Waypoint (global positioning system or GPS trajectories) data that includes vehicle trips from various sources. To determine the association between demographic, economic, and land use information and OD patterns, we acquired Census block group level data from American Community Survey (ACS), and block level economic data from Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD). We provided insights on the relationship between demographic information and OD patterns by Census spatial unit’block group’. Based on multi-source data, we used classification-based association rules mining to determine key association patterns."

This paper 4 investigates the use of the hashtag# VisionZero on Twitter, a popular microblogging platform, to 5 understand public needs and requirements, identify innovative and context-sensitive solutions, 6 and facilitate the exchange of ideas and best practices. To examine the relevance of needs for 7 several different focus areas within VZ, textual content from about 32,000 unique tweets was 8 analyzed using opinion mining, network cluster analysis, and exploratory visual analyses to 9 identify the significance, frequency, and patterns of word strings. Results reveal interesting 10 trends, contexts, and patterns with regard to user reactions to road safety needs, issues, and 11 solutions. This research can help decision-makers in identifying and anticipating the most 12 relevant demands and pressing requirements for different individual areas of interest. Several 13 US cities, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), and states have embraced the Vision 14 Zero strategy. This paves the way for a bigger role for the VZ approach in global road safety 15 efforts aimed at achieving results set forth in the Decade of Action for Road Safety in the coming 16 years. 17"

Social media makes safety campaigns convenient due to its greater accessibility compared to mass media. Most road safety campaigns are fear-based. There is a need to use these campaigns carefully to reach a wider audience. Non-fear-based safety campaigns are limited in number, and their impact is significant in changing public attitudes towards safety. This study collected YouTube comment data from two non-fear-based safety campaigns and compared their impacts by using natural language processing tools.

To infer teen drivers' understanding of crash potentials (factors that are associated with crash occurrence), two sources of data are generally used: retrospective data and prospective data. Retrospective data sources contain historical crash data, which have limitations in determining teen drivers' knowledge of crash potentials. Prospective data sources, like surveys, have more potential to minimize the research gap. Prior studies have shown that teen drivers are more likely to be involved in crashes during their early driving years. Thus, there is a benefit in examining how teen drivers' understanding of crash potentials change during their transition through licensing stages (i.e., no licensure to unrestricted licensure).

Bicycling is becoming popular among people of all groups. In 2016, 130 elderly bicyclists were killed (20% higher than 2014) on the U.S. roadways. The sharp rise of elderly bicyclist fatal crashes calls for a rigorous study to determine the key associated factors in elderly bicyclist crashes. Graphical methods, such as joint correspondence analysis (JCA), are useful in identifying the association patterns from a complex data set with multiple variables by producing a proximity map of the variable categories in a low dimensional plane. This study used 3 years (2014 to 2016) of data on elderly bicyclist fatal crashes from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) in the U.S. to determine the key associations between the contributing factors by using JCA. Some of the key findings …"

The objective of this research was to develop a simple and relatively inexpensive, semi-automated tool for screening crash narratives and expediting the process of identifying crashes with specific characteristics, such as agricultural crashes.\nMethods: Crash records for Louisiana from 2010 to 2015 were obtained from the Louisiana Department of Transportation (LaDOTD).

The recommended changes made by the NCUTCD addresses many of the NTSB recommendations and issued a ballot item for comment to the seventeen sponsors of the NCUTCD, including the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). The task force responded to nearly 100 comments from the sponsors and a revised ballot item was approved by the Regulatory and Warning Sign Technical Committee to be sent to the NCUTCD.\nThe approved ballot item was then forwarded to FHWA quickly, following the January 2019 meeting, for hopeful incorporation in the upcoming update of the MUTCD. 4 Setting of speed limits elicits some of the most passionate technical and emotional responses in our industry. The topic of vehicle speeds and speed limits is one of the most frequently researched topics in our industry. More than two dozen detailed, relevant research efforts were reviewed by the task force.

The greater number of bicyclists on urban/suburban streets may affect vehicle drivers’ speed selections. The hypothesis is that the roadway becomes safer for cyclists as their numbers increase and a greater number of cyclists are visible to motorists, making drivers more cautious about keeping sufficient lateral clearance and reducing speed. Identifying the amount of speed change as a function of the number of bicyclists could provide a better understanding of the potential for changes in bicyclist-vehicle crashes, including variations in crash severity levels. The primary goal of this research was to identify key contributing factors that influence vehicle operating speeds, including the presence of bicyclists on suburban arterials."

Both vehicle volume per lane and bicycle volume were found to be influential inaffecting average speed on lower speed urban arterial roadways. For 40.3 km/hr (25 mph) sites, an increase of 19vehicles per 15-min period would decrease average speed by 1.6 km/hr (1 mph), and an increase of more than 39bicyclists per 15-min period would decrease average vehicle speed by a similar amount. Because of the limited numberof 15-min periods with bicycle counts greater than 1, the research team also developed a model using all available 15-min periods with on-road speed data. Speed and volume data in 15-min increments for 2 weeks at nine sites wereobtained using on-road tubes and via a vendor of crowdsourced speed data. The difference between the tube data andthe crowdsourced data was calculated and called TMCS as a representation of tube (T) minus (M) crowdsourced (CS). The geometric variables that had the greatest influence on TMCS were the number of signals and the number ofdriveways within a corridor. When only including non-congested periods, weekends (Saturday or Sunday) wereassociated with the smallest TMCS."

While encouraging “Green Transportation”, a concerning fact emerges in the United States: pedestrian deaths are climbing faster than motorist fatalities, reaching nearly 6,000 in 2016-the highest in more than two decades. In Louisiana, pedestrian fatalities reached 110 in 2015, nearly 15% of total traffic fatalities. In the same year, Louisiana pedestrian fatality rate (pedestrian fatalities per 100,000 population) is 2.18, higher than the US average of 1.67. This paper presents an analysis of Louisiana pedestrian crashes from 2006 to 2015 with the multinomial logit (MNL) and Bayesian networks (BN) models to explore the potential relationship between pedestrian injury severity and a host of factors including pedestrian behavior, demographics, and built environment. The MNL model is utilized to identify the significant factors, and the BN model is structured to reveal probabilistic dependence between pedestrian crash severity and explanatory variables. The results indicate that fatal and severe crashes are closely linked to pedestrians’ alcohol or drugs involvement and older age. The probability of having a fatal or severe injury crash is much higher for pedestrian traveling on roadways away from intersection area (ie, crossing street or walking along or against roadway). The likelihood of pedestrian crashes resulting in fatality or severe injury increases 49% by walking on unlighted roadways with a speed limit higher than 60 mph at night. The findings of this study show some unique characteristics of pedestrian crashes in Louisiana, which can be useful in selecting the targeted …"

            "description": "Motorcyclists are vulnerable highway users. Unlike passenger vehicle occupants, motorcycle riders do not have either protective structural surrounding or the advanced restraints that are mandatory safety features in cars and light trucks. Per vehicle mile traveled, motorcyclist fatalities occurred 27 times more frequently than passenger car occupant fatalities in traffic crashes. In addition, there were 4,976 motorcycle crash-related fatalities in the U.S. in 2014—more than twice the number of motorcycle rider fatalities that occurred in 1997. It shows that, in addition to current efforts, research needs to be conducted with additional resources and in newer directions. This paper investigated five years (2010–2014) of Louisiana at-fault motorcycle rider-involved crashes by using deep learning, which is a competent tool for mapping a high-multidimensional input into a smaller multidimensional output.

            "description": "This guide describes two different adjustment processes that can be used with pedestrian and bicyclist data. The first adjustment process is seasonal adjustment, which is applied to short-duration counts that are collected during a specific month of the year. Seasonal adjustment annualizes the short-duration counts, such that the resulting adjusted count value is a better estimate of the annual average daily traffic. This guide provides monthly adjustment factors for both pedestrian and bicyclist count data, which is recommended for use with all short-duration count data that include at least seven days of data. The second adjustment process described in this guide is crowdsourced data scaling, which is applied to crowdsourced bicyclist data samples that are collected from global positioning system (GPS)-enabled smartphones. Because the crowdsourced data represent only a sample of the total bicyclists, the number of samples must be scaled or expanded to estimate the total number of bicyclists. This guide describes a simple scaling process that estimates average annual daily bicyclists using the number of crowdsourced data samples, the functional class of the bicyclist travel facility, and the density of high-income households near the bicyclist travel facility."

In 2013, RwD crashes accounted for 59 percent of all motor vehicle traffic fatalities. There are a number of reasons a driver may leave the travel lane such as an avoidance maneuver and inattention or fatigue. Roadway and roadside geometric design features (e.g., lane and shoulder widths, clear zones) play a significant role in whether human error results in a crash, which is the focus of this chapter. Given the fact that ROR crashes accounted for the majority of RwD events and due to the high fatality rate associated with ROR crashes, the factors contributing to this type of crash must be …"

            "description": "While great strides have been made over the past 20 years in reducing the frequency of overall traffic fatalities in the United States (NHTSA, 2016), the data portray a very different perspective with respect to motorcycle crashes. The number of rider fatalities has more than doubled from 2,227 in 1995 to 5,286 by 2016 (NHTSA, 1997, 2017). The increase from 2015 to 2016 alone was a staggering 5.1%(NHTSA, 2017). The magnitude of the motorcycle safety problem is further demonstrated when the number of fatalities in relation to total traffic fatalities as well as the time at-risk of a crash as estimated by vehicle miles travelled is considered. In 1995, rider fatalities accounted for five percent of all fatalities (NHTSA, 1996). This proportion increased nearly three-fold to 14 percent in 2015. This is a significant overrepresentation given that in 2015, motorcycles accounted for less than one percent of all vehicle miles travelled and three percent of all registered vehicles (NHTSA, 2017).\nIn addition, motorcycle riders are far more likely to die or be injured in a crash compared to other motorists. In 2015, motorcycle riders were 29 times as likely to die in a crash compared to occupants in vehicles (NHTSA, 2016). Based on the rate of injury per vehicle mile traveled, motorcycle riders are nearly 5 times as likely as vehicle occupants to sustain an injury in a crash. In addition to the tremendous number of lives lost each year in motorcycle crashes, a number of riders may experience debilitating nonfatal injuries with the potential to cause longterm health problems and decreased quality of life. In 2015 alone, 88,000 motorcycle riders were injured in crashes (NHTSA …"

Researchers evaluated options for permanent and portable counter equipment, and recommended a combination of equipment and locations for both permanent and short-duration counts. Researchers then demonstrated the installation of both permanent and portable counter equipment in Austin and Houston. In an evaluation of crowdsourced data, researchers found that crowdsourced data represented a small (less than 1 percent at some locations) and biased portion of all pedestrian and bicyclist trips, varying widely by data source and location. Further study is needed to develop a systematic expansion process that can be used to estimate total pedestrian and bicyclist counts on different facility types from the crowdsourced data samples. Also, researchers developed a consolidated database that included 350 unique pedestrian and/or bicyclist count locations in 11 cities, of which 84 were permanent continuous count sites and 266 were short-duration (e.g., at least seven days) count sites.

A handful of efforts are underway in the state to install these treatments or others that are intended to improve safety by increasing pavement skid resistance. However, HSIP funds are very limited. Hence, it is necessary to prioritize projects carefully to spend the limited funds where they would yield the greatest benefit in terms of crashes reduced and injuries and fatalities prevented. Documents like the Roadway Safety Design Workbook and the Highway Safety Manual contain much useful information about the safety effects of design characteristics like curve radius and cross-sectional widths, but pavement characteristics are not yet included in these documents. In this research project, researchers calibrated detailed safety prediction models to account for the effects of key curve characteristics, including geometry, pavement variables (particularly skid resistance), and weather patterns. Additionally, researchers developed estimates of the service life for various surface treatments that may be used to increase skid resistance. By combining safety prediction models, weather data, and service life data, researchers created guidelines and a life-cycle benefit-cost evaluation framework to assist practitioners in choosing effective safety treatments for curves."

            "description": "This guide describes scalable risk assessment methods for pedestrians and bicyclists, wherein risk is a measure of the probability of a crash to occur given exposure to potential crash events. This guide outlines eight sequential steps to develop risk values at various desired geographic scales, and describes the scope and nature of each step, including any guiding principles. Exposure to risk is an integral element of risk, and as such, an integral element of the pedestrian and bicyclist risk assessment methods in this guide. Exposure is a measure of the number of potential opportunities for a crash to occur, and is often directly related to the number of people who walk and bike. This guide provides information on analytic methods to estimate pedestrian and bicyclist exposure, and identifies other relevant guides and resources that provide supplemental information for exposure estimation. Depending upon the desired geographic scale, one or more of these three analytic methods can be used to estimate pedestrian and bicyclist exposure: 1) site counts; 2) travel demand estimation models (several different types); and, 3) travel surveys."

A better understanding of factors affecting non-motorized commuting trips would enable stakeholders in non-motorized transit to come up with relevant and cost-effective strategies to promote it. This study aims to improve the understanding of the association between non-motorized commuting trips, crime, and associated demographics. Moreover, this study demonstrates an innovative approach for using yearly crime dataset (Chicago) in conjunction with American Community Survey (ACS) dataset. ACS dataset contains data about non-motorized commuting trips and critical socioeconomic characteristics. An unsupervised data mining technique called Self Organizing Map (SOM) was used to find an association between different factors as it does not require any prior assumptions. The findings show that areas with lower income households are associated with high pedestrian and bicycle commuting. A negative association between crime and non-motorized commuting was also identified. The results also show that areas with larger youth populations are likely to have high non-motorized commuting trips. This study provides insights into the ongoing state of the art study designs and analysis methods associated with non-motorized travel mode."

The focus of this study was the Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting which provides a broad base of participants and interdisciplinary research in the ever-evolving transportation sector. Due to its popularity, this study focused on Twitter interactions surrounding the common hashtag (# TRBAM) for a time span of seven years (2011-2017). Analysis on the persistence of these interactions was conducted for three different time periods surrounding the annual TRB meeting including before, during, and after. Top trending topics included: transit, safety, bike or non-motorized mode of transportation, data, freight, and performance measures. It was found that interactions were more likely to occur during the conference period and dropped significantly after the conference implying the need for a more formal and definite approach for the continuation of communication. The communication pattern shows more dispersion than the central tendency. These findings emphasize the need for transportation research communities to implement and enhance strategies for continuous and active participation surrounding conferences, particularly afterward, among attendees to maintain the momentum of the conference while continuing to expand the traffic safety platform globally."

Road diet (three-lane highway with a two-way left turn lane) remains the most prevalent cost-effective alternative to 4U, still some 4U highway segments have been converted to 5T with an aim of coping with the increasing left-turn traffic towards the roadside establishments without sacrificing the capacity. This study provides an extensive look at the safety performance of 4U to 5T conversion. A total of nine converted sites of different characteristics were evaluated using up to 7 years of crash data before and after conversion. The Empirical Bayes (EB) method was used with LaDOTD developed Safety Performance Function (SPF) and estimated temporal factors to avoid any potential regression-to-the-mean bias. The reduction of crashes was achieved in all the sites with an estimated overall CMF of 0.482 with a small standard deviation of 0.001, indicating a total crash reduction of 51.8% after conversion. The relationship of CMF with driveway density showed that 4U to 5T conversion performed better in driveway densities up to 55 driveways per mile. Analysis by crash type shows substantial reduction of the predominant rear-end crashes on converted urban 5T highways. The high benefit-cost ratio, 77, indicates that 4U to 5T conversion proves to be an effective low-cost crash countermeasure for urban and suburban roadways with low to moderate AADT."

Understanding factors that influence people to biking or bike commuting can help decision makers, transportation planners, and bike commuting networks. Historically, conventional methods like surveys and crash data analyses were conducted to understand relevant factors. Survey and crash data analysis are difficult to perform in broad scale due to data availability and efforts. A novice approach to determining relevant factors is social media data mining to understand sentiments or motivations of bike commuters. People use terms (with hashtag in the beginning of the term) in Twitter, a popular social media network, to express their thoughts, activities or information. In this study Twitter data associated with bike commuting hashtags were obtained for eight years (2009-2016). Different natural language processing (NLP) tools were employed to perform knowledge discovery from the unstructured text data. The methods of analysis performed in this study to understand the bike commuting community, include exploratory text mining to understand most frequent words and temporal patterns; sentiment analysis to understand people’s opinion or sentiments over the years; and a network analysis to help visualize information sharing patterns of Twitter users who share posts on bike commuting. Sentiments over the years on social media in relation to bike commuting has remained more positive than negative. The study shows multiple insights may be gained through social media data mining."

This study examines the safety performance of the TLRs that have been implemented in the North Texas region. TLR prohibit semi-trucks (trucks) from using the left-most freeway lane, or inner lane, except in passing or emergency maneuvers. This study uses 16 sites with TLR in the Dallas-Fort Worth area to conduct an observational before-after study. For safety effectiveness analysis, it is always hard to get three years before and three years after data. For immediate safety effectiveness analysis, sophisticated predictive tools could be used in estimating “after” year crashes. This study used the Enhanced Interchange Safety Analysis Tool (ISATe) to supplement the limited after year crash data. This study used Empirical Bayes (EB) method due to its consideration of regression-to-mean bias. The findings show that TLRs perform an overall positive safety effectiveness for large truck involved fatal and injury crashes for six-lane roadways. This study concludes that implementing TLR as a truck-related safety strategy which are cost-effective to implement, may contribute to improving safety on urban freeways."

Visibility conditions at the time of a crash are rarely documented at a high level of detail. While vision is a key component of how drivers acquire information, a direct relationship between quantified levels of visibility related issues and safety (in terms of crashes) should be identified. One of the factors affecting visibility is inclement weather. According to the Federal Highway Administration, inclement weather contributed to over 13 percent of injury crashes and over 10 percent of fatal crashes in 2013. To examine safety effects of inclement weather driving, the research team used three methods: 1) parametric model (ordinal logistic regression) development to quantify visibility issues by using Florida SHRP2 Roadway Inventory Database (RID), 2) non-parametric analysis (multiple correspondence analysis) to identify key associated factors for inclement weather crashes by using Washington SHRP2 RID, and 3) topic model development by analyzing inclement weather related crash narratives from SHRP2 Insight database. Data collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration maintained airport weather stations that record visibility scores in real-time were linked with Florida RID. The findings indicate that, as expected, the likelihood of a crash increases during periods of low visibility, despite the tendency for less traffic and lower speeds to prevail during these times.

In the literature, the most common definition of risk was a measure of the probability of a crash to occur given exposure to potential crash events. There was also consensus on a theoretical definition of exposure as a measure of the number of potential opportunities for a crash to occur. However, there is wide divergence on operational definitions of exposure, and an even wider range of exposure measures being used in practice. Geographic scale is a critical element in most exposure analyses, and most analyses reviewed could be grouped into one of four scales: 1) regional (e.g., city, county, state); 2) network (e.g., traffic analysis zone, Census tract, Census block group); 3) road segment; and, 4) point (e.g., mid-block or intersection street crossing). This report summarizes numerous examples of exposure estimation methods at these different geographic scales, and discusses the data sources and analytic methods used to estimate exposure in these different geographic scales. Other pedestrian and bicyclist risk factors besides exposure also are cataloged."

The current study merged data collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with 2010–2012 Florida crash data. From the thousands of logged weather events compiled by the NOAA, the researchers isolated periods of normal visibility and comparable periods of reduced visibility in a matched-pairs study. The NOAA data provided real visibility score based on the spatiotemporal data of the crashes. Additionally, the crash data, obtained from Roadway Information Database (RID), contains several geometric and traffic variables that allow for effects of factors and visibility. The study aims …"

If these corridors do not have adequate roadway shoulders available, the pedestrians and cyclists cannot travel on the shoulder and instead must occupy an active travel lane. Consequently, the overall objective of this project was to define the criteria for roadway shoulder suitability for pedestrians and bicycles, apply these criteria to Texas highways to determine candidate locations that merit shoulder improvements, identify high use or high demand locations, and develop a candidate list of potential target locations, coupled with the suitability criteria, to be incorporated into a Strategic Corridor Development Plan."

Particularly in Louisiana, Vehicle-pedestrian crashes have become a key concern because of the high percentage of fatalities in recent years. In 2012, pedestrians were accounted for 17% of all fatalities due to traffic crashes in Louisiana. Alcohol was involved in nearly 44% of these fatalities. Therefore, an extensive research on the pedestrian safety in Louisiana is called for. This research utilized the a priori algorithm of association mining technique to discover knowledge from the vehicle-pedestrian crash database. This paper establishes how to apply association rules mining to discover vehicle pedestrian crash patterns using eight years of Louisiana crash data (2004-2011). The results indicated that roadway lighting at night helped in alleviating pedestrian crash severity. In addition, a few groups of interest were identified from this study: male pedestrians’ greater propensity towards severe and fatal crashes, younger female drivers (15-24) being more crash-prone than other age groups, vulnerable impaired pedestrians even on roadways with lighting at night, middle-aged male pedestrians (35-54) being inclined towards crash occurrence, and dominance of single vehicle crashes. It is clear that data mining approaches help revealing pedestrian crash patterns that may not always follow the intuitive explanations. The findings of this study can be used by traffic safety professionals to develop better pedestrian crash countermeasures, as well as to design campaings to raise awareness …"

As a result, a major concern involves vehicles crossing the centerline and ending in either sideswiping or head-on collisions on undivided roadways. At the same time, improper passing related crashes are also seen on divided roadways. Passing vehicles in either passing permitted or no passing zone requires complex interaction. For this task, a driver needs several judgments based on dynamic variables and allows little room for driver error yet can result in drastic consequences if performed improperly. By seeking to explore these types of crashes even further, researchers hope to gain knowledge that will contribute to reducing both the number of lives lost and severity of these types of crashes. This study used the second Strategic Highway Research Program’s (SHRP-2) Roadway Inventory Database (RID) crash data for Florida rural roadways to investigate improper passing related crashes. This study used an unsupervised data mining technique (known as association rules negative binomial (NB) miner) to extract the knowledge pattern of co-occurrence of the significant variables. The findings of this study would be beneficial for the safety practitioners and policy makers in decision making to reduce crashes due to improper passing."

The users can share their instant thoughts or information on a wide range of topics or interests through 140 characters short messages known as ‘tweets’. Corporations, news agencies, transportation authorities, local governments, airlines and various other agencies use Twitter to share real-time public service information. However, meaningful extraction of information from the large amount of data on Twitter is a great challenge. The prospect of social media for cooperation between citizens and governmental authorities is an evolving issue in theory and practice. This paper examines the promising aspects of using Twitter by the governmental transportation authorities. Based on a dataset of nearly nine thousand official tweets from transportation authorities in two Louisiana major cities, the researchers explored information retrieval aspects of posted official tweets. One year growth of the followers of these official Twitter handles is nearly 48%, which indicates that information distributed through these handles are useful for the followers. The historical tweet frequency indicates the wider use of the official tweets during natural disasters and emergencies. Moreover, this research performed topic modeling on the generated tweets and conducted sentiment analyses on few countermeasures. The results showed mixed sentiments towards these countermeasures. Authorities need to examine negative sentiments more profoundly to improve performance. This …"

In recent years, the transportation profession has given increasing attention to the suitability of the roadway infrastructure for these non-motorized users. For rural roadways, the question of how many people actually use or will use non-motorized trips is a key concern. Developing a corridor for rural roadways that specifically addresses bicycle and pedestrian needs can be beneficial to both planners and users by optimizing available resources. To prioritize the selection of potential shoulder widening locations for safer non-motorized trip, there is a need to determine the number of predicted non-motorized trips per week. This study used National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data to estimate non-motorized trips on rural roadways (two-lane and multi-lane) by applying a machine-learning tool support vector regression (SVR). Findings of this study will help the authority to logically rank the locations with more of these trips higher than locations without the prospect of any bicycle or pedestrian activity."

The research team used crash data of selected intersections in Texas for a six-year period (2009–2014) to perform this study. The types of right-turn lane design considered for analysis included shared lane with island, shared lane with island and dedicated downstream lane, right-turn lane with island, right-turn lane with island and dedicated downstream lane, and shared lane. An examination of the distribution of drivers by miles driven and by involvement in right-turn-related crashes showed that younger drivers were involved in more crashes despite driving less than older age groups. This could be representative of the inexperience or the likelihood of risk-taking behaviors of younger drivers. The characteristics that were examined included right-turn treatment type, presence of a dedicated departure lane, corner radius, and width of the channelized island. For most of the comparisons, the distribution of drivers by age showed similar patterns regardless of the type of right-turn treatment or other right-turn lane characteristic studied— younger drivers are having a disproportional number of crashes. The distribution of drivers by width of the channelized island (measured along the receiving roadway) did indicate that the widest channelized islands might be associated with more older-driver crashes. A larger sample size or a different study method, perhaps a before-after method, might be needed to verify this observation. A field investigation along with a safety before …"

Although various safety models have been developed including the models introduced in the first edition of Highway Safety Manual (HSM) by American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO), these models try to link roadway design features, such as lane with, should width, horizontal curve and vertical grade design with crash occurrences at disaggregated level and require the detailed inputting data and complex application procedures. Transportation planning mainly deals with type and functionality of roadway or roadway network. The HSM crash prediction modes for urban and suburban roadway are complex involving several sub-models for different types of collisions, which makes it hard for transportation planning applications.\nThis paper introduces an innovative crash prediction model with so-called Support Vector Machines (SVM). Being a branch of machine learning, SVM focuses on the recognition of patterns and regularities in data. The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been made possible by many important developments in the underlying algorithms, techniques and readily available open-source programming code.

Accurate AADT data are vital to the calibration and validation of travel demand models, roadway improvement funding allocations and safety performance evaluations. Non-state roads constitute a large percentage (usually 60 to 70%) of the total mileage of a state’s roadway network. Traffic volumes on these roads are generally low, and the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) on these roads is much less compared with that on interstate or arterial roads. Thus, regularly conducting traffic counts is not economically feasible for non-state roadways. This study develops an AADT estimation methodology using Support Vector Regression (SVR). By using available traffic counts at block level on non-state roadways and four variables-namely population, job, distance to intersection, and distance to major state highways at block level-a method to estimate roadway AADT for eight parishes was developed. The current study contributes to obtain better AADT estimates than the conventional parametric statistical methods. With the estimated AADT, the local government agencies can make better decisions on funding allocations for safety improvement projects and pavement maintenance actions. The estimated disaggregate level AADT on non-state local roads can also improve statewide travel demand forecasting models."

            "description": "Traffic flow volumes present key information needed for making transportation engineering and planning decisions. Accurate traffic volume count has many applications including: roadway planning, design, air quality compliance, travel model validation, and administrative purposes. Traffic counts also serve as an important input in highway safety performance evaluation. However, collecting traffic volume on all rural non-state roads has been very limited for various reasons, although these roads constitute a great portion (60 to 70%) of road mileage in the roadway network of any state in the U.S. For example, out of 61,335 miles of roadway in Louisiana, 73% of the roadways are non-state roads. Due to limited resources, traffic volume information on non-state roadways has not been systematically collected in Louisiana. Generally, traffic volumes on these roads are fairly low, and VMT on these roads is much less compared with that on interstate or arterial roads. Thus, regularly conducting traffic count is not economically feasible for non-state roadways. This study develops an AADT estimation methodology by using modern statistical and pattern recognition methods. By using available traffic counts on non-state roadway and four variables (namely: population, job, and distance to intersection and to major state highways at block level), a training set to estimate roadway AADT for eight parishes were obtained by a modified support vector regression (SVR) method. This pattern recognition method yields better AADT estimates than the conventional parametric statistical methods. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted in this study, which indicates a …"

In Louisiana, 34% of crashes are repeatedly committed by the at-fault crash-prone drivers who represent only 5% of the total licensed drivers in the state. This research has conducted an exploratory data analysis based on the driver faultiness and proneness. The objective of this study is to develop a crash prediction model to estimate the likelihood of future crashes for the at-fault drivers. The logistic regression method is used by employing eight years' traffic crash data (2004–2011) in Louisiana. Crash predictors such as the driver's crash involvement, crash and road characteristics, human factors, collision type, and environmental factors are considered in the model. The at-fault and not-at-fault status of the crashes are used as the response variable. The developed model has identified a few important …"

The users can share their instant thoughts or information on a wide range of topics or interests through short messages known as ‘tweets’. Meaningful extraction of information from the large amount of data on Twitter is a great challenge. Corporations, news agencies, transportation authorities, local governments, airlines and various other agencies that share real-time public service information use Twitter. The prospect of social media for cooperation between citizens and governmental authorities is an evolving issue in theory and practice. This project examines the promising aspects of the governmental transportation authorities in providing information to the people. Based on a dataset of nearly nine thousand official tweets from transportation authorities in two major Louisiana cities, the researchers explored how local authorities attempted to provide information to roadway users through Twitter. Semantic analysis performed on the neat and tidy dataset helps extract knowledge from the tweets. This study demonstrates how text mining retrieves knowledge from official transportation information tweets. It is clear that Twitter usage in governmental information sharing has a significant impact, which enables users to share important information under extreme weather or other calamities. The frequent term analysis from both of the Twitter handles is similar. The tweets are mostly related to terms like ‘congestion’,‘blocked’,‘lane/lanes’,‘accident’and ‘open’.

            "description": "Bike sharing is considered a state-of-the-art transportation program. It is ideal for short or medium trips providing riders the ability to pick up a bike at any self-serve bike station and return it to any bike station located within the system’s coverage area. The bike sharing programs in the United States are still very young compared to those in European countries. Washington DC was the first jurisdiction to devise a third generation bike sharing system in the US in 2008. To evaluate the popularity of a bike sharing program, a sentiment analysis of the riders’ feedback can be performed. Twitter is a great platform to understand people’s views instantly. Social media mining is, thus, gaining popularity in many research areas including transportation. Social media mining has two major advantages over conventional attitudinal survey methods—it can easily reach a large audience and it can reflect the true behavior of participants because of the anonymity social media provides. It is known that self-imposed censor is common in responding to conversational attitudinal surveys. This study performed text mining on the tweets related to a case study (Capital Bike share of Washington DC) to perform sentiment analysis or opinion mining. The results of the text mining mostly revealed higher positive sentiments towards the current system."

These roadways carry one-third of the total vehicle 4 miles traveled (VMT) and have experienced a considerably high percentage of fatal crashes 5 in Louisiana. A careful analysis indicates that a wide variety of factors appear to be 6 associated with the crash dynamic of rural two-lane highways. The roadway variables 7 include segment length, pavement width and type, shoulder type, and traffic volume. Crashes 8 recorded from 2004 to 2011, of which 1,780 were fatal, and 36,569 resulted in injuries, were 9 analyzed. It is found that there are a large number of highway segments which contain no 10 crashes under the recorded years.

It concluded that placing pavement edge lines on rural two-lane highways in Louisiana can not only change the lateral positions of the vehicles but also reduce crashes. The Crash Modification Factor (CMF) for edge line on narrow, rural two-lane highways is 0.78. Considering the decreasing trend in crashes in the state for the past three years, the modified CMF is 0.83, which implies that, on average, implementing edge lines can reduce 17% of crashes. As an extension of the 2011 project, this study not only used two more years of crash data for the after time period but also applied the Empirical Bayes (EB) method in the analysis to estimate the crash reduction factors. Moreover, crash characteristics analysis is performed in this study to compare the difference before and after edge line implementation. Additionally, this project performed benefit and cost analysis. By considering the safety trend in Louisiana, the final estimated CMF is 0.85, which means there is a 15% expected crash reduction in edge line implementation on narrow, rural two-lane highways. The statistically estimated standard deviation for the CMF is 0.039. The crash reduction is consistent in all crash types and particularly significant in single vehicle crashes. Most of single vehicle crashes are ROR crashes, which is the exact type of crash targeted by edge line implementation. The benefits overwhelmingly offset the cost with edge line …"

The target group of this research is limited to single vehicle fatal crashes and the 13 related contributing factors. The current commonly used crash analysis methods lack the 14 ability to identify the cluster of factors simultaneously. The Multiple Correspondence 15 Analysis (MCA) method is an exploratory data analysis method that can visualize the 16 patterns of the cluster consisting of crash contributing factors. This paper uses the MCA 17 method to analyze eight years (2004-2011) of single vehicle fatal crashes in Louisiana in 18 order to identify the important contributing factors and their degree of association with the 19 crashes. The results reveal that the combination of impaired driving, particularly on 20 undivided roadways with no streetlights at night, is most likely associated with run-off fatal 21 crashes. Other combinations resulting in ROR fatal crashes include: young males driving on 22 a wet surface during the weekend, older female drivers (64 plus in age) on hilly terrain, 23 distracted motorcycle drivers, and female drivers age 35-44 using cell phones while driving. 24 The results of the MCA can guide the selection of crash countermeasures. The future 25 work on the degree of association of the identified crash contributing factors can help safety 26 management systems select the most effective and efficient crash reduction strategies. 27 28"

About 5,000 mi of these highways are administered by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development. Run-off-roadway (ROR) crashes are the most common type of crashes on narrow, rural two-lane highways. Because the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices does not require edgelines, edgelines are not found on many such highways because of their low traffic volumes. There are two main concerns for edgeline implementation on narrow two-lane highways: the potential increase in head-on collisions and the added maintenance cost to the already constrained annual maintenance budget. The second part of a study that evaluated the safety impact of edgelines on narrow, rural two-lane highways in Louisiana is presented. On the …"

By analyzing seven years of crash data from Louisiana, this paper investigates crash-prone drivers’ characteristics and estimates their risk to have crashes in the seventh year based on these drivers’ crash history of the past six years. The analysis results show that quite a few drivers repeatedly had crashes; seven drivers had 13 crashes in seven years; and the maximum number of crashes occurring in a single year to a single driver is eight. The probability of having crash(es) in any given year is closely related to a driver’s crash history: less than 4% for drivers with no crash in the previous six years; and slightly higher than 30% for drivers with nine or more crashes in the previous six years. Based on the results, several suggestions are made on how to improve roadway safety through reducing crashes committed by drivers with much higher crash risk as identified by the analysis."

Intuitively convinced by their safety benefits, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LADOTD) has been using RPMs for many years on all freeways in the state. Because of the not-sopositive RPM Crash Modification Factor published in the first Highway Safety Manual, the state has to evaluate safety benefits of RPMs in a warm climate. A study was conducted by the Louisiana Transportation Research Center to investigate RPM safety impact on freeway crashes with nine years of data. The safety effect of freeway striping was also evaluated, since the condition rating on RPMs and striping are made concurrently every year. The analysis results from the three methods indicated that RPMs have a significant effect in reducing crashes, particularly nighttime crashes at all AADT levels. For Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) under 20,000, the probability of getting a positive safety effect is given by the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) as 0.26 with a 1.13 Crash Modification Factor (CMF) and a standard error of 0.2. For the same AADT, the probability of a positive safety effect was estimated by this study as 0.97 on rural freeways. The analysis results also indicated that RPMs do not have any safety benefits on urban freeways."

Parking facility service evaluations play an important role in urban transportation planning and operation. This paper introduces a level of service (LOS) concept based on a comprehensive parking study in Beijing, China. The LOS methodology developed by an integrated evaluation model reflects the user's perception of the quality of service. The method combines four important service variables, namely the ratio of peak-hour demand to capacity, average parking space occupying rate, parking cost, and circulation time, into one single index to quantitatively evaluate a parking facility's performance."

            "description": "The previous study Impact of Edge Lines on Safety of Rural Two-Lane Highways completed in 2005 concluded: with edge lines, centralization of vehicles’ positions is more apparent during night time, which reduces the risk of run-off road (ROR) and head-on collisions, and edge line markings generally cause drivers to operate their vehicles away from the road edge, irrespective of the roadway alignment. Does the changed vehicle lateral position reduce the frequency of crashes? Answering this question is important to Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LADOTD) since implementing and maintaining edge lines on narrow two-lane highways require significant resources from LADOTD. More than 40 percent of rural, two-lane highways in Louisiana has a pavement width (excluding shoulders) less than 22 ft. with no edge lines. Thus, the goal of this project was to investigate the safety impact of edge lines on narrow, rural two-lane highways in Louisiana by analyzing crash frequencies before and after edge line implementations on a group of selected narrow, rural two-lane highways from all LADOTD districts. Using the latest safety analysis statistical method, this project analyzed the crash data before and after edge line implementation and concluded that: placing pavement edge lines on rural two-lane highways in Louisiana can not only change vehicles’ lateral positions but also reduce crashes. The crash modification factor (CMF) for edge line on narrow, rural two-lane highways is 0.78. Considering the decreasing trend in crashes in the state for the past three years, the modified CMF is 0.83, which implies that, on average …"

            "description": "Vehicle being at fault in a crash has extensively been associated with its driver's behaviors and other human errors for human-driven vehicles (HDV). The introduction of automated vehicles (AVs) is expected to eliminate such human errors due to the ability of AVs to communicate with the external environment. However, various reports have documented AVs being at fault in collisions. This study applied text mining and mixed-effects logistic regression (MELR) on crash data involving AVs collected between 2017 and 2022 in California to explore the likelihood of an AV being at fault during a collision. It was found that among 497 crashes, a relatively small percentage (14.29%) involved AVs being at fault. The text network results revealed patterns of keywords associated with the AVs being at fault. Such patterns include conventional mode of operation, area of impact, and resulting injuries. Furthermore, with about a …"
