            "description": "Recent advancements in sequence modeling have led to the emergence of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) as an efficient alternative to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers, addressing challenges in long-range dependency modeling and computational efficiency. While RNNs suffer from vanishing gradients and sequential inefficiencies, and Transformers face quadratic complexity, SSMs leverage structured recurrence and state-space representations to achieve superior long-sequence processing with linear or near-linear complexity. This survey provides a comprehensive review of SSMs, tracing their evolution from the foundational S4 model to its successors like Mamba, Simplified Structured State Space Sequence Model (S5), and Jamba, highlighting their improvements in computational efficiency, memory optimization, and inference speed. By comparing SSMs with traditional sequence models across domains such as natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, vision, and time-series forecasting, we demonstrate their advantages in handling long-range dependencies while reducing computational overhead. Despite their potential, challenges remain in areas such as training optimization, hybrid modeling, and interpretability. This survey serves as a structured guide for researchers and practitioners, detailing the advancements, trade-offs, and future directions of SSM-based architectures in AI and deep learning.",

            "description": "Quantum computing introduces new computational methods that address complex optimization and machine learning challenges in transportation engineering. This literature survey reviews fundamental quantum principles, including qubits, superposition, entanglement, and quantum gates, and examines their applications in transportation. Fundamental quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and Grover's search, are described for their applications in transportation, such as network analysis, traffic management, and vehicle routing. Quantum optimization techniques, including hybrid quantum-classical approaches and quantum annealing, have been explored for combinatorial challenges such as the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and dynamic traffic signal control. Additionally, quantum machine learning models, such as Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) and quantum clustering, present applications in traffic prediction and anomaly detection. Despite its potential, quantum computing in transportation faces challenges related to hardware limitations, error rates, and a lack of established quantum programming frameworks. Addressing these challenges necessitates progress in hardware scalability, error mitigation techniques, and algorithm refinement. As quantum computing continues to evolve, its integration into transportation engineering could improve computational efficiency and enable new capabilities in optimization, traffic management, and intelligent transportation systems.

            "description": "Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of automated vehicle (AV) crash severity is critical for advancing urban mobility safety and infrastructure planning. In this work, we introduce ST-GraphNet, a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework designed to model and predict AV crash severity by using both fine-grained and region-aggregated spatial graphs. Using a balanced dataset of 2,352 real-world AV-related crash reports from Texas (2024), including geospatial coordinates, crash timestamps, SAE automation levels, and narrative descriptions, we construct two complementary graph representations: (1) a fine-grained graph with individual crash events as nodes, where edges are defined via spatio-temporal proximity; and (2) a coarse-grained graph where crashes are aggregated into Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Indexing (H3)-based spatial cells, connected through hexagonal adjacency. Each node in the graph is enriched with multimodal data, including semantic, spatial, and temporal attributes, including textual embeddings from crash narratives using a pretrained Sentence-BERT model. We evaluate various graph neural network (GNN) architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Dynamic Spatio-Temporal GCN (DSTGCN), to classify crash severity and predict high-risk regions. Our proposed ST-GraphNet, which utilizes a DSTGCN backbone on the coarse-grained H3 graph, achieves a test accuracy of 97.74\\%, substantially outperforming the best fine-grained model (64.7\\% test accuracy). These findings highlight the effectiveness of spatial aggregation, dynamic …",

While TinyML initially focused on enabling simple inference tasks on microcontrollers, the emergence of TinyDL marks a paradigm shift toward deploying deep learning models on severely resource-constrained hardware. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of the transition from TinyML to TinyDL, encompassing architectural innovations, hardware platforms, model optimization techniques, and software toolchains. We analyze state-of-the-art methods in quantization, pruning, and neural architecture search (NAS), and examine hardware trends from MCUs to dedicated neural accelerators. Furthermore, we categorize software deployment frameworks, compilers, and AutoML tools enabling practical on-device learning. Applications across domains such as computer vision, audio recognition, healthcare, and industrial monitoring are reviewed to illustrate the real-world impact of TinyDL. Finally, we identify emerging directions including neuromorphic computing, federated TinyDL, edge-native foundation models, and domain-specific co-design approaches.

            "description": "The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems, where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models, integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware, and intelligent transport infrastructures.",

            "description": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in scientific machine learning, offering a mesh-free, data-efficient approach for solving forward and inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their rapid adoption, PINNs face persistent challenges in training dynamics, scalability, and theoretical guarantees. This survey provides a comprehensive and critical review of the field, combining mathematical rigor with practical insights. We begin by outlining the theoretical underpinnings of PINNs, including how physical constraints are embedded into neural networks through differential operators and automatic differentiation. We then examine the landscape of training strategies-such as adaptive loss balancing, collocation sampling, and optimizer choices-and review key extensions including XPINNs, VPINNs, and fPINNs, designed to address long-time integration, multi-scale phenomena, stochasticity, and fractional PDEs. Applications across domains like fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, and biomedicine demonstrate PINNs' versatility in simulation and inverse modeling. Comparative analysis with traditional solvers and data-driven models highlights trade-offs in accuracy, flexibility, and scalability. We also discuss benchmark datasets, software libraries, and emerging best practices. The survey concludes by identifying key open challenges and research directions at the intersection of physics, artificial intelligence, and numerical computation, aiming to guide future development in robust and scalable PINN methodologies.
