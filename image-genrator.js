  description:
    "Shared Use Paths (SUPs) are becoming very popular in North America due to the current initiatives that promote active travel. SUPs can accommodate different types of users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, scooterists, and skateboarders. Although the interest in SUPs continues to increase, relatively less research has been performed on their utilization, especially using revealed preferences. Therefore, this study utilizes the survey data collected from Edmonton, Canada, between June 12th to 19th 2018 to explore the likelihood of utilizing the SUPs and the associated frequency of use. Results indicate that not all variables associated with the likelihood of utilization are also associated with the frequency of use. Specifically, higher levels of education influence the likelihood of SUP utilization, while the higher frequency of SUP usage is influenced by the secondary modes of transportation. On the other hand, as the ...",
